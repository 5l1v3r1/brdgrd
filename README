brdgrd is short for ``bridge guard'': A program which is meant to protect Tor
bridges from being scanned (and as a result blocked) by chinese probes [1].

The program runs in user space and makes use of libnetfilter_queue to get
packets passed from kernel to user space. Only TCP SYN segments are passed to
user space: brdgrd is only interested in TCP handshakes and not in established
TCP connections. Hence, the performance implications are minimal.

brdgrd exploits a number of chinese scanning characteristics in order to be able
to block probes:
- Scanners mostly connect within three minutes after every 15-minute-interval.
  Within this short interval, brdgrd acts deaf and blocks all new connections.
- The IP address 202.108.181.70 was found to be a special scanner. It appears
  in many scans and is statically blacklisted by brdgrd.
- Chinese scanners seem to have set their TCP retransmissions to 1. After the
  one and only retransmission failed, the scanners give up. So brdgrd only
  accepts SYNs if at least two retransmissions were observed. Recent versions of
  Windows and Linux both do this.

If brdgrd assumes that a connecting host is a chinese scanner, it tells the
kernel to drop the SYN segment. We can not tolerate false negatives since a
_single_ successful chinese scan leads to the block of a bridge. The very
purpose of brdgrd is to avoid this. So we have to trade off many false positives
for (hopefully) no false negatives.

Most options are configurable. E.g., you can increase the required
retransmissions (and lock out many users) or you can increase the ``deaf
window'' (and accept more false positives).

You should make sure that brdgrd only deals with chinese IP addresses so that
bridge users from other countries are not affected. The following hack does
this:

-----------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -e delegated-apnic-latest ]; then
	wget http://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/delegated-apnic-latest
fi
CN=`cat delegated-apnic-latest |
	awk -F\| '/^apnic\|CN\|ipv4\|/ { print $4"/" 32-log($5)/log(2) }' |
	aggregate -q -`
RETVAL=$?
[ $RETVAL -eq 0 ] && echo "Successfully parsed chinese network list."
[ $RETVAL -ne 0 ] && (echo "Failure in parsing chinese network list." ; exit)

for NET in $CN; do
	iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport <bridge-port> -s $NET -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 1
done
-----------------------------------------

Afterwards, you can compile brdgrd by typing ``make'' and start it by typing
``./brdgrd -v''.
